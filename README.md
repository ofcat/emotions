Topic Introduction

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for the purpose of emotion classification using a Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains labeled text entries with emotions such as Joy, Love, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Surprise.
The primary goal of the project is to explore and apply a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to accurately classify emotions from text data.

Specifically, the objectives of the project are:
● To gain hands-on experience with various NLP methods.
● To maximize the accuracy of emotion prediction through different approaches.
● To compare the implementation complexity and predictive power of traditional ML models versus modern
Transformer-based models.

We have explored various methods to classify emotions from text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By employing both traditional models—such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines—and modern approaches like CatBoost and BERT, we aimed to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification.

Our results indicate that while traditional models performed consistently, CatBoost emerged as the top-performing model among regular ML with 89.75% accuracy after rigorous hyperparameter tuning. However, BERT, a Transformer-based model, offers higher accuracy of 92.0% and the potential for further improvements in predictive performance.
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with diverse NLP techniques and highlighted the trade-offs between implementation complexity and model accuracy.
